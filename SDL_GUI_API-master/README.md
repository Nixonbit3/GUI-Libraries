# SDL_GUI_API
An extensible GUI library implementing SDL with C++ with support for basic UI elements and easy customisability

Please read tutorial.txt and GUI_Test.cpp for a brief overview. The rest of the explanations can be found at the header files, if they are documented.

This was a really imoulsive idea that came to me and I just started working on it. I don't plan on working on it further but if you have a similar idea, you can use this as a starting point. Everything is easy to understand, from the code to the implementation. Since it was built to be highly customizable, you can adapt the project to however you like it to be. No need of credits or permission or other such things to use it.
